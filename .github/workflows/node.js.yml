This GitHub Actions workflow is set up for continuous integration (CI) to automatically test your Node.js project across different versions of Node.js. Here's a breakdown of each part of the workflow:

Workflow Name
Node.js CI: This is the name of the workflow.
Trigger
push: This triggers the workflow on pushes to the main branch.
pull_request: This triggers the workflow on pull requests targeting the main branch.
Jobs
The workflow defines a build job with the following setup:

runs-on: ubuntu-latest
This specifies that the job should run on the latest available Ubuntu virtual environment.
Matrix Strategy
node-version: The workflow runs the job across different Node.js versions specified in the matrix (18.x, 20.x, and 22.x). This ensures compatibility with multiple Node.js versions.
The Node.js release schedule can be checked at: Node.js Release Schedule.
Steps
Checkout code:

actions/checkout@v4: This action checks out the code from your repository so the workflow can work with it.
Set up Node.js:

actions/setup-node@v4: This sets up the Node.js environment for the specified version in the matrix (node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}) and enables caching for npm to speed up subsequent runs.
cache: 'npm': This caches the npm dependencies, which helps to avoid downloading the same dependencies on every run.
Install dependencies:

npm ci: This command installs the project dependencies using package-lock.json, ensuring a clean and consistent installation across environments.
Build the project:

npm run build --if-present: This runs the build script (if defined in your package.json). If there's no build script, this step will be skipped.
Run tests:

npm test: This runs your test suite, typically using a test runner like Jest, Mocha, or similar.
